# MARQOV
(Abstract/Intro/Header)
The place where the High performance MARQOV Code will take shape...

write 2-3 sentences what your code does. 

>  Magnetic systems offer themselves as the
ideal benchmark for generic concepts pertaining to collective phenomena in nature. This is
due in part to the availability of a large variety
of diverse magnetic materials that can be chosen to approximate simple theoretical “toy
models” of collective behavior and, in part, to
their ease of study by a battery of experimental
techniques. <br>

## Prerequisites/environment
Give some hints about the environment that your program expects.
Is it meant for an HPC System? a Desktop? Windows/Linux?

### tools
Note the tools that you require. 
Fortran Compiler? Python interpreter? bash for scripts?

### external libraries
Note the external library dependencies:
You need Lapack? Boost? 

### included libraries
you copied some source files from somewhere else into your code?
Please note here which libraries/programs/source files you copied
in which version/git commit and also note their license.
Note that this may affect the freedom you have in choosing your license!

## Configuration
Gives some hints about the configuration of your program,
wether it is using command line arguments or config files
and try to give some suitable default/starting values from
which one can try to understand your code.

## Testing
Think abot incorporating tests into your program.
Ideally you can include them into gitlab's CI pipeline: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/
We provide some Docker images you can use for your environment here: https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/Z03/pdi

## Usage
Note on how to use your program. Is it part of a bigger piepeline with programs that are dependent on it?

## References
Note the references that you used to create the code,
but also give the publications that are related to your work on the code.

## Todo Doc #
A hint for yourself, here you can give todos for the documentation.

## Todo Code #
Doc available here: https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/tschwemmer/wcrg_2d_orbital/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/doc/main.pdf?job=create_doc
A hint on what's left to do in the code.

### Notes
A place for other notes.
- Did you implement something fancy that others might be interested in?
