# Invaded cluster algorithm

#### Key facts:

* not a general purpose algorithm (can only be used to simulate the model at the critical point)
* locates the critical point all on its own and very fast ("negative feedback")
* variant of the Swendsen-Wang algorithm, where clusters are built according to a cluster invasion percolation scheme
* does not sample the Boltzmann distribution exactly

#### Prerequisites

* understand [invasion percolation](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/flow/MMproject/Wilkinson1983.pdf)
* understand [Swendsen-Wang cluster flipping mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swendsen%E2%80%93Wang_algorithm)

# Worm algorithm

The Worm algorithm does not operate on the space of spin configuration but is rather a diagrammatic sampling method, operating on the space of bond (in the spirit of a high-temperature expansion).

#### Prerequisities

Understand high-temperature expansion (HTE) and (associated) diagrammatic loop counting

# HMC
Hamiltonian/Hybrid Monte Carlo
 - For the SO(3) Heisenberg model EOMs are known that work directly on the [phase space of spins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4114.pdf) Hence no need for auxiliary momenta.
